/*
I wanted to build a program to randomly select a food choice when given two options. Though this program is basically a glorified coin flipper,
it occured to me that one of the major troubles people have when flipping a coin is deciding which choice should be "heads" and which should be tails,
and then remembering which choice corrisponded to which side. Minor problems, granted, but I still believed I could impliment a better way very quickly.
To solve this problem, I simply chose to have the user input their options directly, and thus let the computer keep track of which choice was attached to which option.

Additionally, the computer randomizes or "flips" three times over, to give the user a structured number of trials, but still more than one;
in theory, people won't just keep running the program over and over again as might be the case with a single trial setup.
