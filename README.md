# FoodChooser
# This program may help the user make choices using random chance. Originally designed for food, I expanded it to be applicable and helpful for all people and all choices they may seek to make. All inputs must end with a ".", "?", or "!" (without quotation marks). Otherwise, the computer won't understand the end of your input. Enjoy!
